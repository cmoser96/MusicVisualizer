# TODO for the project:

- [x] remove old code
- [x] add keyboard input
- [ ] switch from Pulse Simple API to Asynchronous API
- [x] switch build system to cmake
- [x] reorganize code into src/ and include/ folders
- [x] add some documentation for dependencies/use
- [x] add basic functionality of switching rendering functions without having to recompile (Just display both)
- [ ] look into splitting up the FFT rendering based on frequency ranges (bass seems consistently high with little change)
